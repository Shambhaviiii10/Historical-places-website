  <p>The Red Fort is a fort located in Delhi, India.  The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was responsible for the construction of the Red Fort, which was intended to function as the palace fort for his capital city of Shahjahanabad. The fort, which encompasses a total area of 255 acres, is designed in a variety of architectural styles, including Persian, Hindu, Timurid, and Islamic. The monument got its name from the red sandstone that was used to construct its massive enclosing walls, which stretch for a total of 2.5 kilometres. While marble is used for the majority of the construction of the fort, red stone is used for a few specific parts of the structure. The building is in the shape of an irregular octagon, and in addition to turrets, bastions, pavilions, two gates, and a number of other sections, it also incorporates elements of garden design.
